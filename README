ControlByFiles
==============

At the moment all it can do for you is running rake tasks.
To do that first setup a cronjob which crontab's entry looks like this:

* * * * * cd /your/rails/root ; export RAILS_ENV=development; ruby vendor/plugins/control_by_files/lib/control_by_files.rb

just adjust the absolute path to your Rails application and the environment in
which you would like to run the "control by file script" in. Add it to your
crontab with "crontab -e". Be aware of the fact, that this configuration will
run the script every minute. This shouldn't be a problem, but maybe you would
like it to run less often. Just edit the crontab line accordingly.

Now just put a rake.txt in the tmp/ folder of your Rails application. This file
can contain rake parameters. Any new line indicates a new rake run. E.g.:

-T
db:migrate

will end in "rake -T" and "rake db:migrate" run after each other.
The result of that will be printed back into the rake.txt file so that you can
have a look at it.
